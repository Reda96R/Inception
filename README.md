# Project Overview:
This project is intended to learn about the concept of **Containerization** and why we need it, and also to Gain practical experience in Docker image creation, management, and deployment.
# Background theory:
Let's imagine this story, After months of burning the midnight oil, you crafted a masterpiece of an application: a sleek, intuitive, and downright revolutionary tool that promised to change the way people interacted with technology.  With a triumphant click of the "Deploy" button, you sent your creation out into the world, confident in its ability to dazzle and delight. but soon enough, Reports started pouring in of crashes, glitches, and inexplicable errors, Panicked, you dove headfirst into the code, scouring every line for clues as to what had gone wrong. Hours turned into days, and days turned into weeks, but the elusive bug remained elusive. in the end, It turned out that your application had been built on a fragile foundation of libraries, frameworks, and third-party services, each with its quirks and idiosyncrasies. And when deployed to the wild, these dependencies clashed and collided like tectonic plates. 
As we bid farewell to you and your epic struggle with software deployment, it's essential to acknowledge the truth that every developer will eventually face the specter of deployment woes and will visit us all at some point in our coding journeys. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting on your coding adventures, thanks to **Containerization** which has emerged as a game-changerâ€”a transformative technology that promises to revolutionize the way we build, deploy, and manage applications. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable units called containers, what exactly are containers, and how do they work? In the next section, we'll dive deeper into the world of containerization, exploring its history, principles, and practical applications. So buckle up and get ready to embark on a journey into the heart of this transformative technology.
